(General)
Gonna place out some time to learn express, and focus on understanding
how the backend work.


(Planning)
I will perform 'sandbox learning', as I don't have a clue how to connect
the FE stuff to the BE. I don't want to break the application or mess
with any of the front end features just yet.

So the current plan is; however I may need time integrating and learning
about other technologies, before I can implement any BE session
management.

1) Sandbox learning - Express and create a simple app
2) Sandbox learning - Integrate session management


Will need to consider some security aspects of a website written in JS.

Learning - How do Express.js sessions work?

https://nodewebapps.com/2017/06/18/how-do-nodejs-sessions-work/

In this article, I want to share:

 - What is a session?
 - How do sessions store data?
 - How do you determine where to keep your session data?
 - What security implications do you have to be aware of when working with sessions?
