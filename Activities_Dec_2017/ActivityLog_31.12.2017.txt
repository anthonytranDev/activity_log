Decided to build my entire create a webpack config from scratch again; means going
through the tutorials again.

Create a webpack for ES6.
Create a webpack for React and ES6.

To give us absolute control over the entire project.

const webpackConfig = require('./webpack.config');


This is a clever way of organising the app.

where the package.json file can run these config.

Base Config = webpack.config.js
Dev Config = webpack.config.js + webpack.config.dev.js => Development
Prod Config = webpack.config.js + webpack.config.build.js => Production

module.exports = Object.assign(webpackConfig, {
    devtool: 'eval',
    output: {
        pathinfo: true,
        publicPath: '/',
        filename: '[name].js'
    }
});

To Do

Aim: To learn enough of the below to configure a user session in
relation to the application - the basics + applied learning

Learn to create a webpack config and env [ < 4 hours]
Create a webpack for ES6.
Create a webpack for React and ES6.
Learn how to use express.js - [1 Day - 16 hours (excluding break time)]
Learn how to use mongoDB - [1 Day - 16 hours (excluding break time)]

(Notes)

Sometimes when learning something new, a concept that we believe we get,
is combined with another concept. To make the experience and reading
documentation easier and for faster adoption. The documentation must be
as universally friendly as possible.
This allows the documentation available for everyone.

Empathy training
  - understanding what the audience knows
  - understand what concepts the audience knows
  - understand whether they have had the chance to combine 2 of the
    concepts together

Proposed new ideas,

Started programming toggle - make more details more verbose to beginner
programmers.
   - Tests for this is to remove or add specific parts of information, see
     whether the message is clear. Is the Author's intent clear.
   - Remember that quizzing a user whilst they are using the documentation; i.e.
     questions is different from
   - After noticing the lack of Service and UX design in many industry, from
     from 1st hand experience, such as academia.
     Users/students are afraid to move forward, due to lack of information as
     well as understanding and knowing what fundamental questions to ask.
   - Know that some folks will need more additional aid understanding, due to
     lack of knowledge, or asking the write questions.
   - User personas of different people, from what kind of questions they ask
     themselves, rather than just relying on what they react.

Have a difficulty gage, based on

- number of years of experience the person has
- whether he or she finds it hard

Managed to integrate ES6 into this webpack config - there should be some
webpack config map with notes - as whenever some developer jumps on to the
the codebase it does quick slow down the whole team;

  - Adding new members
  - Adding more people into the team

Increases communication overhead - too many devs spoiling the codebase.

On a lighter note, please include webpack config for;

  - ES6
  - ES6 + Express
  - React
  - React + Express
  - React + Express + MongoDB + Passport
  => Full on session management, After
    + Account Setup - Mlabs, Heroku etc

Remember to have full documentation, on the use of libraries and tools;
include a timestamp for activity.
