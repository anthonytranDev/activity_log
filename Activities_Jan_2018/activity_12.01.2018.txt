ServiceWorker problem - [16:22]

(Improvements)

Needs to fix entire 'installation workflow',
Quick off the top of my head solution

  - download Yarn globally
  - have documentation of the list of tools that are there
    - better have some kind of self-updating json (must be some kind of tool online for)

1) 'Vi' Learn vi basics

2) 'Git' stage files individually and commit individually, try atomize individually the
   the files that want to

   Useful Reddit posts

   i) Git commit - A commit is your smallest working unit, so if you have what should
   be 5 commits jammed into 1 -- you are going to have a bad time.

   ii) Woah, I've always wondered about rebase but never had a reason to use it on my
   personal projects. Thanks for the useful read!

The hack house idea -> is the most organic way to grow a proper incubator in the UK,

When loading up the machine, we need some way to stop from clogging up the screen.
  - Better still we can have the machine load plainly
  - Then have a command to load my design/env + dev/env
  - Have a super user workflow

Word of caution, the current Yeoman generation of the firebase app requires you to
have all the options installed, you'd expect if this top quality it would just
include the installations you'd only need - what a shame.

The generated app for yeoman is pretty buggy at this moment in time, you’d expect it to
as convenient as create-react-app, it’s kinda unfortunate, they have nice boilerplate
config files

If you forget to engage .gitignore, especially when there are loads of files in node_modules,
It’ll slow git kraken the hell down

Being pretty tired, has  cause me to accidentally delete all of my activities
logs. What would be nice, is if I had an app that could export individual
files or entire folder of logs

A lot of hours have been spent, trying to fix the ServiceWorker problem.
If the problem ever arises; it would occur in Chrome

alt + cmd + 'I' > Application > Unregister the 'service worker'
