(One Thing)

Is learn express basics today,

because I currently am not able to connect
to API, as one has not been built with a 7 week time frame,

thus the app
isnâ€™t able to respond to any data stored by the client -  i.e. people
cannot sign up on the app.

> Admin - However I do need to get my financials in place, so that I can
receive money into my bank account without any hiccup, first.

  - To stop paying for the course fees, the one that I was originally on
    - Don't need that Level 3 qualification at all
