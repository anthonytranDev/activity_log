Heard that Jonny has had a monster merge error, from the
amount of auto-conflict he's had.

The plan now;

Stop any git activity, no pushing and pulling from any repo;
prevention is best method, to stop the entire team from
exacerbating the current situation further, before we have
enough information.

This is the current assumption;

Jonny   | thechamp         -> "heroku repo"
        | the-champ-finale -> "actual project repo"
        | => in the same folder

Anthony | thechamp         -> "heroku repo"
        | the-champ-finale -> "actual project repo"
        | => in two different folder

There may be different merge error problem, that could exist
have different repo for both files.

[Gonna start by using names rather than pronouns]
Anthony is unsure whether, Jonny knows about the concept of
different branches of master.

  master/origin
  master/heroku

Should have research into Git and Merge Error prevention best practices

The main mistake we made, was not prevent and mitigate the mistake from
ever occurring with either hard/soft control methods - chemical engineering

We need a checklist for ways for structuring the entire codebase.

Whilst waiting for Jonny's video call, Anthony is going to spend more time
learning about express and building a better picture of how the FE-BE API
works.
