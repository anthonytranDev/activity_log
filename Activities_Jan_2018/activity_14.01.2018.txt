Forgot to update the log yesterday. So what I've learnt.

  - Firebase + React -> Learn how to write the the data on to the
    page, understood how the React component life cycle fit in
    with updating the component and retrieving data from the

  - Unfortunately I didn't exactly complete my one thing yesterday
    which was to READ the firebase data
      - Well the app kinda read the data, but looking at it all from
        a holistic point of view. I still didn't focus all my
        efforts into reading the data using on() and once()
        ...
        Who know those utility functions may no longer exists, as I
        could read the data totally fine

  - One thing today is utilize the video tutorial, till I get up to
    Integrating React with Firebase for app we have built - (anything
    I do extra is a bonus)

Just return back from the family congregation and meeting, some old
usually meet up session.

Now requires spending time towards completing my 'One Thing'.

Wasn't able to do that smoke test to see if the entire repo worked in
my environment as it required setting up a database and authentication
- I wasn't able to study the authentication part yet, wasn't gonna
risk it.

- Due to how busy the entire day was from 12:30 - 20:00, most of the day
  was gone, this One Thing needs to carried over to the next day
