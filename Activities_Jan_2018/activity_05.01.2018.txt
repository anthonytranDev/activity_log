(General)

Unfortunately a lot of happened, and I forgot to update the activity
log, however I do have individual time stamps more the important
parts of the previous day.

(Meeting)

Skype with Doug [04.01.2018: 18:35 - 19:30]

Key Points:
  - How to justify the valuation?
  - Working on the backend -> Let's base it on the assumption that
    whatever Jonny delivers is great, if he doesn't deliver anything
    that is fine
  - Monday, rather than have a hardcore meeting, on a detailed
    discussion of future plans. More or less a casual business social
  - Doug used the analogy of having a steam market place for gambling
    games - embedding their gambling API
  - Anthony mentioning the network effect, Metcalf's law and the
    valuation of highly dense and populated social networks
    (I still need to pass on the idea).
  - Doug then mentioned the idea of using the Champ Feature as a possible
    pivot point.

Other Points

  - Viral Cooefficiency - Start up school Y-Combinator Facebook Growth Team
  - With company success, Shaun may decide to jump on board, being COO

Resulted in a document - that kinda looks like a term sheet-ish doc, but
I don't have a clue what it is


(Planning)

Aims:

  - Making Potential Edits to the existing document if possible.
    Making a Copy of the Original if some parts.
      - Suggestions include using Doug + Shaun's One Thing framework; have
        an overall encompassing aim, that both sides can agree on
  - Carry Reading, Studying + Reviewing "Venture Deals" - Brad Felds
  - Ignore any programming/design for now;

Questions to ask Doug

What the document is - to be honest I forgot to ask; solely focusing on
what was the document at the time; i.e. what he was writing down?
Reasons for the document?
