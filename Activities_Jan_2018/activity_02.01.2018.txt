(General)
Spent the majority of the pass day with family for New Year, and some of the time
learning about Clean Code, Best Practices + just delved into design patterns
hence no activity log for 01.01.2018.

(Planning)

Now the focus is go back to producing a successful boilerplate file that uses
ES6 + Express. This is derived the plan 31.12.2017 below;

- ES6
- ES6 + Express
- React
- React + Express
- React + Express + MongoDB + Passport
=> Full on session management, After
  + Account Setup - Mlabs, Heroku etc

Please bare in mind that there are other things you can include in webpack to
improve performance, however they are not as important and initial chapters -

Code Splitting
Lazy Loading
Caching
Authoring Libraries
Shimming
TypeScript
Progressive Web Application
Migrating Versions
Environment Variables
Build Performance
Dependency Management
Public Path

[Please notes on Webpack learning]

Spent some time on tooling with nodemon and browsersync, doesn't seem to work.

Possible Solutions

  - Learn how to use webpack middleware
    - include nodemon and browsersync plugin
  - Possible remove the middleware component from the server file, and recode
    the entire logic for it

Just noticed a possible boo boo, I was using middleware in another file without
realising - originating from the previous webpack tutorials.

Recommendations were to keep the backend functionality side of webpack,
integrated into the server file - performance related
