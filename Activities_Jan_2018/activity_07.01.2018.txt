Managed Read chapter 11 and now on chapter 12
Venture Deals Brad Feld - Pg 238

Just noticed that some parts of the book, isn't too relevant to
the activities we will be doing in the future. However it's
important to plan around every investors exit strategy.

(Planning)

0) Finish them flash cards
1) Summarise the parts of the book, you find relevant
2) Read other peopleâ€™s summaries
3) Produced a revised version

Aim:

  - Learn the relevant definitions; find hypothetical scenarios you can
    relate to

  - Narrow down which points and themes in the book that you have learnt
    from; applying the Pareto Principle,
      - based on the most probable occurring
      - ones that have the greatest impact

The main aim now is to

2) Then the rest of the planning resides on focus reviews of the entire book
